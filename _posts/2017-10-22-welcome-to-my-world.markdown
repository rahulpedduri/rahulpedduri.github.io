I started this blog with an idea of sharing what I've learnt; And so have my past ~6 blogs. 

Its the same every time. I start by saying that its a programming blog and write an arrogant **about** page, plan to write regularly, as a way of keeping track of my solutions. As I start to blog about it, I feel foolish by the time I finish the draft. 

"Nah, somebody must've already written about this, what is the point in me writing it again." 

"Ahh, thats such a silly problem, its laughable." 

More often than not I run into problems that I want to blabber about. I recently took interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This is a new attempt at blogging that. Hopefully, it will last. 

I don't want to claim that this is a coding blog but most likely it will turn into one, given my interests.
