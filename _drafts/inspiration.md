I usually like to solve interesting problems. So, this one time a collegue sent me an email asking my help in solving a hard problem they have. The weied thing about that request was that, this collegue was from a different department altogether. I was was pleasantly surprised and agreed to help. 

We scheduled a meeting and he started explaining the problem and it almost seemed like I have solved this one before. While he was giving me a detailed explanation, he showed his research on the matter. He showed me **my** blog post about solving a very similar problem. 

This kindled my interest in writing blog posts again. I do write stuff but most of them are met with severe overthinking from me. I don't want to write about anything that is already available online. Now, that is a hard requirement to achieve, one that makes me delete drafts after a few re-reads. I hope I find interesting problems to solve, especially ones that can't be solved easily and no one else has posted about it already.
