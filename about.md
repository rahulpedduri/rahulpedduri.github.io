A blog about experiences. Now, that can be anything from personal experiences to thoughts and insights. You can call me a geek(kinda), so expect a lot on coding stuff. 

# Me

Introvert. Developer. Gamer. That about sums up me. :)

I am a `developer`. Now, I want that _definition_ to be broad because, I like to solve interesting problems. Then again, I am a developer in the field of big data. 

If you want to know more about me as a developer, you should visit my [stackoverflow][so] and [github][gh] profiles

As for the blog: 
* I don't like to plagiarize stuff. If I use something, I will credit them. If you find something that isn't, please let me know.  
* Its great that you took my advice but, please don't bet your life on it. Do your research. I might be wrong sometimes. 
* If I am wrong, please feel free to point it out. I will correct it. 
* Advices are welcome.
